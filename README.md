      My name is Christopher but you can call me 
      <span><b><em>Chris</em></b></span>. 
      I'm an 18 years old Lebanese sleep-deprived individual who fell in love with programming 4 years ago. I'm a 2nd year computer science student at one of the most prominent university of my country. I really enjoy working on personal projects with the sole purpose of getting better at writing efficient code in a multitude of languages and I'm keen on keeping abreast of the latest frameworks and technology.

      I write code in a multitude of languages, but the ones I'm most familiar with are: <b>C#</b>, <b>C++</b> and <b>Java</b>. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm planning on sharpening my <b>Python</b>, <b>NodeJS</b> and <b>Go</b> skills over the next few months as well as learning <b>ReactJS</b> and <b>VueJS</b>.
      <br>
      <br>
      I enjoy developing libraries, desktop applications and back-end services. I'm not fan of the <b>front-end</b> though, I'm more of a <b>back-end</b> and software developer. I really don't enjoy designing websites or user interfaces.
      <br>
      <br>
      I would love to get into <b>Machine Learning</b>, <b>Deep Learning</b> and <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> at some point in the future. I'm also eager to learn game development using <b>Unity</b> or <b>Unreal Engine</b> and be part of a team that will build a game from scratch.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm familiar with <b>Reverse Engineering</b>; a concept I find really interesting. I have disassembled, analyzed and debugged various executables in the past for fun, getting a better understanding of Assembly x86 and x64 in the process. I would like to take it a step further and become a <b>bounty hunter</b> once I gain enough experience in this field.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm a person who likes to jump on the bandwagon and learn new things, so I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills which consists mainly of working on personal and team projects regardless of whether or not I/we succeed in completing them. What's important to me is the knowledge and experience that I gain along the way as well as the ability to properly plan, organize, design and implement code together with the team I'm part of, consisting most of the time of me and my homies which makes communication and collaboration a breeze.
